I am **Sayantika Roy**, currently pursuing my M.Tech in [Microelectronics and VLSI Design](https://microelectronics-eecs.iisc.ac.in/) at [Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore](https://iisc.ac.in/).

I am a part of [NeuRonICS Lab](https://labs.dese.iisc.ac.in/neuronics/) at [Department of Electronic Systems Engineering](https://dese.iisc.ac.in/), where I am exploring emerging computing paradigms, particularly **Quantum Computing Hardware**.

Research Interests
=====
My research interests lie at the intersection of hardware and emerging computing paradigms, especially in:

- Quantum computing and qubit control systems  
- Neuromorphic and non-von Neumann architectures  
- Hardware-software co-design for energy-efficient systems  
- FPGA-based system development

I enjoy exploring unconventional architectures and system-level design approaches that enable intelligent, energy-efficient computing. Iâ€™m passionate about bridging the gap between algorithms and hardware, and contributing to the future of scalable, high-performance computing systems.

Beyond Academics
=====
Outside the world of circuits and qubits, I love exploring the arts and all things creative! Hereâ€™s a peek into what keeps me balanced and happy:
* :dancer: Dancing â€“ Rhythm is in my bones! I learnt Kathak, Rabindra Nritya and Odissi, completed 5th year diploma in Kathak.
* ðŸŽ¨ Painting - I love creating detailed **mandalas** - theyâ€™re like meditation with a pen!
* :cookie: Baking - Cakes, cookies, and occasional kitchen experiments :yum:.
* :camera: Photography - Capturing moments when words fall short. Check out my Flickr account [here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/sayantikaroy217)
