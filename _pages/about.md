{% include base_path %}

Hi! I'm **Sayantika Roy**, a second-year M.Tech student in [Microelectronics and VLSI Design](https://microelectronics-eecs.iisc.ac.in/) at [Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore](https://iisc.ac.in/).

I'm currently part of [NeuRonICS Lab](https://labs.dese.iisc.ac.in/neuronics/) in the [Department of Electronic Systems Engineering](https://dese.iisc.ac.in/), where I'm just beginning to explore the exciting world of **Neuromorphic Computing, Hardware Accelerators** and other emerging technologies.

Research Interests

I'm still figuring out my path, but I'm really curious about:
  
- Neuromorphic and alternative computing architectures  
- Hardware Accelerators for AI and ML
- Making systems more energy-efficient through smart hardware-software co-design  
- Building cool stuff on FPGAs

Right now, I'm mostly learning by doing â€” trying out new ideas, asking questions, and getting my hands dirty with tools and hardware. Iâ€™m especially excited about how new kinds of computing systems might change the way we solve complex problems.

Beyond Academics

When Iâ€™m not trying to decode circuits or figure out how quantum things work, I love getting creative. It helps me stay grounded and happy!

* :dancer: **Dancing** â€“ Iâ€™ve been trained in **Kathak** (completed 5th year diploma), **Rabindra Nritya** (till 4th year), and **Odissi**.
* ðŸŽ¨ **Painting** â€“ Especially detailed **mandalas** â€” itâ€™s super calming, like meditation with a pen.
* :cookie: **Baking** â€“ From cakes and cookies to random kitchen experiments :yum:
* :camera: **Photography** â€“ I like capturing small moments that feel worth holding on to. You can check out some of my photos on [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/sayantikaroy217).

Let's Connect!

Iâ€™m just starting out in the world of research and tech, and Iâ€™ve got a lot to learn â€” but Iâ€™m always curious and up for a conversation.
