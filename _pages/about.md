Welcome! I’m **Sayantika Roy**, currently pursuing my M.Tech in [Microelectronics and VLSI Design](https://microelectronics-eecs.iisc.ac.in/) at the [Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore](https://iisc.ac.in/).

I am a part of the [NeuRonICS Lab](https://labs.dese.iisc.ac.in/neuronics/) at the [Department of Electronic Systems Engineering](https://dese.iisc.ac.in/), where I am exploring emerging computing paradigms—particularly **Quantum Computing Hardware**. My research interests span across:

- Quantum computing and qubit control systems  
- Neuromorphic and non-von Neumann architectures  
- Hardware-software co-design for energy-efficient systems  
- FPGA-based system development
