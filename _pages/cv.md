Projects
=====
* Hardware Implementation of Hopfield Neural Network with AER for Solving Maxcut Problem: March'25 - April'25
  * Course Project: Neuromorphic AVLSI
  * Designed and Simulated an HNN with AER which solves Maxcut Problem using Verilog.
  * Implemented on FPGA Board.

* RGB Image Filter Implementation and HDMI Display on FPGA: March'25 - April'25
  * Course Project: Digital Systems Design with FPGA
  * Designed an RGB Image filter which uses Median filtering to remove salt and pepper noise, implemented it on PYNQ-Z1 board and displayed the output result on monitor using HDMI protocol.
  * Used two different median algorithm- Fast Median and Bit Voting based Median algorithm.

* IMU Sensor Controlled Car
  * Open Day Demonstration Project 2025
  * Built an ESP32-controlled car that uses an IMU sensor for motion-based control. The L298N motor driver handles the DC motors, while a servo motor steers the car. Tilting the IMU sensor moves the car in the corresponding direction.

* 16 Bit Signed/Unsigned Radix-4 Booth Multiplier with Power Gating: November'24 - December'24
  * Course Project: Digital VLSI
  * Simulateda16-bit multiplier using Booth encoding andWallace tree structure using Cadence virtuoso.
  * Designed an area-optimized layout for the circuit.

* Air Quality Monitoring System: September'22-December'22
  * Project Guide: Dr. Ankita Pramanik, Dept. of E&TCE, IIEST Shibpur
  * Built an air quality monitoring system using Arduino and gas sensors.
  * Showedthe real-time values in a website built using HTML, CSS & JavaScript.
