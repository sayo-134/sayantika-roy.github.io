My research interests lie at the intersection of hardware and emerging computing paradigms, particularly in:

* Quantum Computing Hardware
* Neuromorphic Computing
* Hardware Acceleration for Machine Learning

I enjoy exploring unconventional architectures and system-level design approaches that enable intelligent, energy-efficient computing. Iâ€™m passionate about bridging the gap between algorithms and hardware, and contributing to the future of scalable, high-performance computing systems.
